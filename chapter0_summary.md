## This is just a summary. Any sentence/terminology used here is the idea and work of Philip N. Klein 


Terminology:


Set: collection of objects in which the elements occur once.
Element belongs to set if it is contained in the set

If a set A contains all elements of another set B and may be some other elements then B is a subset of A.

Set A=B if and only if A is subset of B and B is subset of A

Cartisian Products: of two sets A and B is the set of all possible pairs of elements of A and B (AxB).

Cardinality: of a set A is the number of elements in the set represented as |A|
Rule: |AxB|=|A|.|B|

Functions:
pre-image---> input associated with domain of Function f
imag----> output associated with co-domain of Function f

Procedures:
A precise description of every possible steps of a computation (Accepts inputs/arguments and produces output/return value)

Computational Problem:
Specification of Input and output that needs to be followed by Procedure.

Differnce between Funtions, Procedures and Computational Problem:
Funcions and Computational Problems do not detail on how to solve a problem as many procedures can satisfy a problem or a function.
A computational problem need not specify output for every input while a function needs to do so.

Relation between Computational Problem and Function:
Forward Computational Problem from domain to codomain and Backward computational problem from codomain to domain.
Finding forward and backward procedures is key in mathematics but is very diffcult if we generalize the function.
For elaboration read book.

Identity Function:
Function mapping Domain D-> D is Identity Function.

Composition of Functions:
A function f mapping Domain A-> B and g mapping B-> C, then composition of function g(f) is mapping of A to C.

Associativity of Function Composition:
h(gf)=(hg)f

Functional inverses:
Function f and g are said to be inverses of each other if and only if:
f(g) and g(f) and identity functions.


Invertible Function:
Function may not have inverse. If it does then such function is called invertible.

For a function f to be invertible the mapping from domain D to codomain F  must be one to one and all the elements in F must
have an element mapped back in D. Other term f needs to be one to one and onto respectively.

Fact: Every function has atmost one inverse i.e. number of inverse =0 or 1
