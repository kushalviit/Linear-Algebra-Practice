This repository has been created with the intension of practicing linear algebra with coding.

The material used for coding and learning linear algebra is "Coding the Matrix-Linear Algebra through applications to Computer Science" by Philip N. Klein.

Though the book uses python for coding, this repository/work is being aimed at creating both Python and C++ codes.


This is currently work in progress, so you may find parts of code not working.Do read the commit messages for more info.

Please bear with me until its completely up and out.
